/*
Design a method that takes an array of positive integers and returns the indices of the two distinct integers in the array that sum up to a specific target value.

Notes:

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
Can you think of at least two solutions/algorithms to solve the problem: one that is space efficient and another that is time efficient?
Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].

Add on challenge: Extend your solution so that it returns all pairs of indices that solve the problem.
